This is a project from Front End Developer students Helena Edblad, Patrik Eriksson, Omi Gibba, Mariia Loskutova, Emmelie Engstr√∂m and Monica Gomez.

It is an application for searching job ads, and it is based on the [Swedish Public Employment Service API](http://jobtechdev.se/swagger/).

Our goal with this assignment was to practise team work, version handling with git and principles for securing good code quality.

The application is built with HTML and Javascript.
